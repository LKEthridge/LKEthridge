- ⚡ Fun fact: I have taught newcomer English learners K-8 for the past six years.  My passion for data-driven decision-making, language learning, and the potential of AI to increase equity in classrooms, the justice system, and healthcare prompted me to undertake a rigorous bootcamp, where I am growing my skillset as a tech professional daily.
